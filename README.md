# SBV subtitle shifter

There are probably converters I could have used, but none of the Linux programs I tried could shift all SBV subtitles after an insertion/deletion point by a constant time.

This works well and the export can be given directly to YouTube.

It may sit unused, because I've allowed Youtube to try to guess the times. It did a great job when I was correcting its first attempt.

After about an hour Youtube has come back to me with re-synced subtitles. I love it. It took my words and lip-synced. So attentive! The timings are a little different, but that's because some words have been re-flowed to adjacent lines. Just to re-iterate; YouTube took my words, verbatim. Very happy with that.
