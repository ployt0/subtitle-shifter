# SBV subtitle shifter

![python-app workflow](https://github.com/ployt0/subtitle-shifter/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

There are probably converters I could have used, but none of the Linux programs I tried could shift all SBV subtitles after an insertion/deletion point by a constant time.

This works well and the export can be given directly to YouTube.

It may sit unused, because I've allowed Youtube to try to guess the times. It did a great job when I was correcting its first attempt. It takes a long long time though. So probably this script will see use once again.
