# SBV subtitle shifter

There are probably converters I could have used, but nont of the Linux programs I tried could shift all subtitle after an insertion/deletion point by a constant time.

This works well and the export can be given directly to YouTube.

It may sit unused, because I've allowed Google to try and guess the times and it did a great job when I was correcting its first attempt. It takes a long long time though. So probably will use this script again.
